I have been an obsessive learner in the past.

After lot of explorations and trial-and-errors, I have curated a list of books and courses that have been most helpful to me.

These are my go-to list of books and courses. Whenever I am stuck or want a refresher, I go back to these resources.

The biggest paradox that a Data Scientist faces is the choice paradox. There are so many resources, courses and books available on the internet, that deciding which one to pursue is a huge challenge!

I want to keep this list minimal, and hence I am only listing the ones that I have actually used and the one that have been most helpful to me.

Most of these are free resources.

However, some are paid and the links to them are my affiliate links (if you choose to make a purchase using these links, I will earn a small commission for recommending the resource to you).

Also, the courses done by me are not very lengthy courses as in my experience, working on real projects has been a better approach to learn data science, than only doing courses. 

Your learning approach might be differnet from me.

Still, I recommend not investing a good amount of money and/or time on a course, before experimenting on a few projects on your own.

Specially, when you can learn most things for free and good resources.

After you try your hands on a few projects, you can then invest your time, energy and/or money on a course.

I have read about the approaches to learn data science from seasoned Data Scientists and Kaggler or Hackathon rank holders. Many of the seasoned Kagglers have not done any course at all, but only read books and worked on projects to gain experience.

Of course, doing a course, and in parallel working on projects could be a good approach as well.

My personal approach has been to run Kaggle notebooks to learn Python, doing a Udemy course with lot of exercises to learn SQL, reading books to learn deep learning, learning R as a part of my Masters curriculum, working on Kaggle competitions and explore Kaggle winning solutions etc.

Also, building this website and working on miniature case-studies have been extremely beneficial. I got to know about the concept of building resume-website from the youtube channel of Python programmer. This YouTube channel has been a good resource to know about books and courses as well.

To get the concepts of deep learning properly, I have tried reading a few books, one of which is available for free on internet.

My favourite go-to places when I am stuck with a problem are kaggle.com and analyticsvidhya.

Below is the list of my favourite resources for learning Data Science.

1. Free kaggle notebook to learn Python pandas
2. Free kaggle notebook to learn Python numpy
3. Free kaggle course to learn Machine Learning
4. Trying the getting started competitions on Kaggle
5. SQL course on Udemy to learn SQL with plenty of complex exercises (Free alternative: SQL tutorials on w3schools)
6. Paid deep learning book (Free alternative: deep learning ebook)
8. Power BI tutorials on Lynda.com
9. R refresher course on Coursera
10. Statistics refresher course on Coursera
