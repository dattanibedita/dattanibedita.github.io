This is an online resume website for a data science profile. I built this website is to demonstrate small projects done by me. I also want to test how easy or difficult it is to build a website from scratch for free, without zero web-development knowledge and zero HTML/Java coding skills.

Trust me, you can have your own resume website framework in just a day even if you have not built any website or have no web-coding knowledge.

I did specific case-studies to show on this website, which I executed in Python. This is optional and you can use a coding language of your choice, like R. You might not need any coding as well, if you are presenting the results and you gravitate more towards storytelling.

Whenever I will apply for a job, I will give the link to my website and the recruiters can look at my work-samples.

If you too, are a data scientist, I highly recommend building a website for yourself.

Not only you show your capabilities, but building a website can be immensely satisfying as well.

I had the basic framework for this website in 6 hours.

If you have not used github before, even then it won't take you more than 6 hours to build this website.

I had to figure out everything from scratch and had lot of failures on the way. If you follow the steps mentioned by me, it might take you as little as 2 hours to build your own website.

So, follow along!

I am breaking up the entire procedure in 3 simple steps.

1) Start a Github page. For this, watch this 10 minute YouTube video which gives you the step-by-step tutorial.

2) Install a page-theme and follow the step-by-step instruction on the help document. I used this theme.

3) Write Ipython notebooks using any platform you like. I used Jupyter notebooks. Then you need to convert your notebook to HTML. I achieved it by going to Anaconda prompt, navigating to the location of your Ipython notebook and running the following command:

ipython nbconvert notebook.ipynb

It will convert your IPython notebook to html. In case you don't know, html is the programming language using which webpages are written.

If you directly upload an Ipython notebook to github, it will look wierd, with lot of slashes and dashes.

After you convert your IPython to html, it will become a cleanly readable document on your webpage, when you upload it to github.

So that's all you need to do. If you have any suggestions or questions, let me know! Connect with me on LinkedIn and send me a link of your resume website. I will be glad to take a look at it!
