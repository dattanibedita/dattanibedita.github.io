title: How to build a website like this one? (no html coding needed)

This is an online resume website for a data science profile.

The purpose of this website is to demonstrate small projects done by me.

I am doing specific case-studies to show on this website. That way, whenever I apply for a job, I give the link to my website and the recruiters can look at my work-samples.

If you too, are a data scientist, I highly recommend building a website for yourself.

You do not need any web-development experience in order to build such a website.

I had the basic framework for this website in 3 days.

All you need is the skill to write IPython notebooks and some basic github knowledge.

If you have that, it might take even less. If you have not used github before, even then it won't take you more than 3 days to build this website.

I had to figure out everything from scratch and had lot of failures on the way. If you follow the steps mentioned by me, it might take you as little as 1 day to build your own website.

So, follow along!

I am breaking up the entire procedure in 3 simple steps.

1) Start a Github page
2) Install a page-theme and follow the step-by-step instruction on the help document
3) Write Ipython notebooks using any platform you like. I used Jupyter notebooks. Then, go to your Anaconda prompt, navigate to the location of your Ipython notebook and run the following command:

ipython nbconvert notebook.ipynb

It will convert your IPython notebook to html. In case you don't know, html is the programming language using which webpages are written.

If you directly upload an Ipython notebook to github, it will look wierd, with lot of slashes and dashes.

After you convert your IPython to html, it will become a cleanly readable document on your webpage, when you upload it to github.

So that's all you need to do. If you have any suggestions, let me know! If you have a video tutorial, let me know as well, so that I can upload it on my YouTube channel.
