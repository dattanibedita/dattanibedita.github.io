<p>Hello! Thanks for checking my work! </p> 
<p>I am Nibedita, a Data Science Professional with  7+ years of experience.</p> 
<p>I am passionate about data science and Statistical Modelling. I have experience in various commercial projects, including implementation of Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning, Tensorflow, text mining, Market Mixed Models, A/B testing, Time-Series forecasting, automation etc, using Python, R and other tools. To be more specific, I have worked on text sentiment analysis, summarization, theme extraction, data visualization and exploration, feature engineering, value-driver analysis, root-cause analysis, casual inference, multi-variate time-series etc. </p>
<p>I love challenging problems, but I also love framing business problems. I have come up with some project ideas which have created value for the organizations I have been associated with, while some of them could not be implemented. </p>
<p>I have a Master degree in Statistics from Indian Statistical Institute (an institute of national importance in India). Some academic courses taken by me include Multivariate analysis, Statistical inference, Algorithms and data structures, Bayesian inference, Linear Models and Markov chains etc. with a specialization in Actuarial Statistics. My Masters thesis titled "Generalization of Principal-Agent methods with continuum of effort" was an application of Game Theory. </p>
<p>My volunteering experience includes acting as a Teaching Assitant for the course "Intro to Software Engineering" on Codepath.org in order to help students from underrepresented backgrounds prepare for job interviews by solving Python assignments. </p>
<p>Thanks for reading so far! For any queries or feedback please feel free to <a href=https://dattanibedita.github.io/#contact>Contact me!</a> </p>
