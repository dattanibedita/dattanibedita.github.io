<p>Hello!</p> 
<p>I am Nibedita Datta, a Data Scientist having 6 years of experience.</p>
  <p>In these 6 years, I have introduced myself whenever I have been in a new room.</p>
  <p>Having said my introduction so many times, I do not have any problem to write it here, once more.</p>
  <p>I have done my Master in Statistics from Indian Statistical Institute.</p>
  <p>Before that, I graduated from Presidency College, Calcutta, with a BSc., Statistics Honours degree.</p>
  <p>In my work-life, I have been fortunate to work on a variety of projects - from operations risk management, </p>
  <p>sentiment analysis and NLP, A/B testing and Marketing-Mixed-Models, to determining expry date of drugs!</p>
  <p>I wanted to work on some projects during my free-time, for increasing my breadth of data science.</p>
  <p>I framed the questions and problem statements for these projects, and collected data from the web.</p>
  <p>I intend to cover simple web scraping, image recognition, text mining, Exploratory Data Analysis and 
  <p>statistical modeling on this website.</p>
  <p>I have not gone into massive projects on this site as I wanted to keep it simple here.</p>
  <p>I have done extensive in-depth projects in my work-life and participated in hackathons in the past.</p>
  <p>If you have a job opportunity, please [Contact me](https://dattanibedita.github.io/#contact)!</p>
  <p>I love travelling, so if you have a job role that involves travelling, please let me know!  </p>
