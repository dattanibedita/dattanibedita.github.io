<p>Hello! Thanks for checking my work! </p> 
<p>I am Nibedita, a Data Science Professional with  6+ years of experience.</p> 
<p>I am passionate about data science and have worked on Statistical Modelling (predictive time-series, marketing mixed models, A/B testing, churn prediction etc.) in Python, R, SAS etc. I have experience working in Natural Language Processing and text mining using Python and Microsoft APIs, dashboarding using Power BI etc.</p>
<p>I find the creative process of translating business problems to a solvable data science problem extremely interesting. I have worked on framing problems and working on their solutions using data science tools. Some specific areas I have worked on in this respect are text sentiment analysis, summarization, theme extraction, some data visualization projects, value-driver analysis, root-cause analysis, casual inference, multi-variate time-series etc. </p>
<p>I love learning new techniques and deep diving in the mathematics behind models. I often check books and papers that discuss in detail the mathematical background of models.  </p>
<p>I have a Master degree in Statistics from Indian Statistical Institute (an institute of national importance in India). Some academic courses taken by me include Multivariate analysis, Statistical inference, Algorithms and data structures, Bayesian inference, Linear Models and Markov chains etc. with a specialization in Actuarial Statistics. My Masters thesis title "Generalization of Principal-Agent methods with continuum of effort" was an application of Game Theory. </p>
<p>My volunteering experience includes acting as a Teaching Assitant for the course "Intro to Software Engineering" on Codepath.org in order to help students from underrepresented backgrounds prepare for job interviews by solving Python assignments. </p>
<p>Thanks for reading so far! For any queries or feedback feel free to <a href=https://dattanibedita.github.io/#contact>Contact me!</a> </p>
<p>Data science is a fascinating domain. Are you excited about data science, too?</p>
