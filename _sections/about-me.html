<p>Hello! Thanks for checking my work! </p> 
<p>I am Nibedita, a Data Scientist with  6+ years of experience.</p> 
<p>I am passionate about data science and have worked on Statistical Modelling (predictive time-series, marketing mixed models, A/B testing, churn prediction etc.) in Python, R, SAS etc.. I have also worked on NLP and text mining using Python and Microsoft APIs, dashboarding using Power BI etc.</p>
<p>I have also found and solved Business Problems using machine learning. I have worked on Natural Language Processing problems (sentiment analysis, data visualization, theme extraction) and predictive modelling problems. </p>
<p>I love learning new techniques and deep diving in the mathematics behind models. Since I have a Master in Statistics degree in Statistics, I often check books and papers that discuss in detail the mathematical background of models.  </p>
<p>I have a Master degree in Statistics from Indian Statistical Institute (an institute of national importance in India). I am also interested in learning efficient coding and have gone through some online materials on Computer Science (CS50 course lectures by Harvard University), siftware engineeing and version control systems etc. </p>
