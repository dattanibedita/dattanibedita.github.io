<p>Hello! Thanks for checking my work! </p> 
<p>I am Nibedita, a Data Scientist with  5+ years of experience.</p> 
<p>I am passionate about data science and have worked on Statistical Modelling (predictive time-series, marketing mixed models, A/B testing, churn prediction etc.) in Python, R, SAS etc.. I have also worked on NLP and text mining using Python and Microsoft APIs, dashboarding using Power BI etc.</p>
<p>I have also found and solved Business Problems using machine learning, along with my colleagues. I also have explored a few kaggle problems.</p>
<p>I love learning new techniques. I have basic idea of setting up projects in Microsoft Azure, git version control system, and I have also done a Google Analytics certification. These are initiatives that I took outside of my work, as I am a curious data scientist. I have learnt SQL. Although I have not worked hands-on using SQL, my skills are fair and working a few months would give me momentum. </p>
<p>I think cultural aspect is very important when it comes to work and I love to work in a team, participate and facilitate discussions about new ideas and build solutions to projects by collaboration. </p>
<p>I have a Master degree in Statistics from Indian Statistical Institute (an institute of national importance in India). My experience is across the domains of Pharma, Healthcare, Operations Risk Management, Oil and Gas etc. </p>
