<p>Life is too short for boring intros. Agree?</p> 
<p>I do not want to bore you with credentials. At least, not right now.</p>
<p>Let me start with my hobbies. You will be able to explore my traits as I talk about what I love doing.</p>
<p>I love learning new facts, quizzing, and making puzzles.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I love them even more than Data Science (Trait #1: I am honest!)</p>
<p>I can spend hours solving riddles and puzzles. And recently, I have started making puzzles.  (Trait #2: I love challenges!) </p>
<p>You can attempt a few puzzles on this website. Googling is allowed, which means you will not find these puzzles on Google anywhere else.</p>
<p>Check them out clicking this link (to be updated), if you love puzzles!</p>
<p>I also run pages on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram where I post new facts everyday. You can see my personality on Youtube where I have uploaded a few videos.</p>
<p>For doing all these, I have learnt a lot. I learnt elements of graphic design, video editing, bits of comedy acting, SEO and social mdeia analytics, videography, social media post scheduling, social media algorithms and lot more! (Trait #3: I love learning new things!) </p>
<p>I have started my pages in May 2019, and have more than 800 followers on Facebook by August 2019 (Trait #4: I am a go-getter!)</p>
<p>Finally, let me summarize my data science career briefly (Well, now I will bore you for a minute). </p>
<p>I have a Master degree in Statistics from Indian Statistical Institute (an institute of national importance in India), 6 years of experience across domains (Pharma, Healthcare, ORM, Energy etc.). I have worked on a range of projects - from multivariate Time-Series forecasting, Marketing-Mix-Models, to determing expiry date of drugs, sentiment analysis and text mining. (There is more to this list, but I am keeping it short) </p>
<p>I also self-learnt a range of things, you can see some of which in the "Portfolio" section.</p>

<p>Data science is a fascinating domain. </p>
