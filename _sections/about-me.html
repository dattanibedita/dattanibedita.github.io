<p>Hello! I am Nibedita Datta, a Data Scientist having 6 years of experience.
  In these 6 years, I have introduced myself whenever I have been in a new room.
  Having said my introduction so many times, I do not have any problem to write it here, once more.
  I have done my Master in Statistics from Indian Statistical Institute.
  Before that, I graduated from Presidency College, Calcutta, with a BSc., Statistics Honours degree.
  In my work-life, I have been fortunate to work on a variety of projects - from operations risk management, 
  sentiment analysis and NLP, A/B testing and Marketing-Mixed-Models, to determining expry date of drugs!
  I wanted to work on some projects during my free-time, for increasing my breadth of data science.
  I framed the questions and problem statements for these projects, and collected data from the web.
  I intend to cover simple web scraping, image recognition, text mining, Exploratory Data Analysis and statistical modeling on this website.
  I have not gone into massive projects on this site as I wanted to keep it simple here.
  I have done extensive in-depth projects in my work-life and participated in hackathons in the past.
  If you have a job opportunity, please [Contact me](https://dattanibedita.github.io/#contact)!
  I love travelling, so if you have a job role that involves travelling, please let me know!
  </p>
