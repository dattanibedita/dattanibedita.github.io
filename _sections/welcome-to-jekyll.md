Thank you not only for your interest in my work, but for being curious about data science.

This is a fascinating age of technology, where there is so much information out there, for free, on the internet.

Using these information, we can learn and execute new things and connect with like-minded people.

If you are a fellow data-scientist, I would totally encourage you to set up a website showing your work. It is easy and simple, and I would write a blog post about how to do it.

If you are a recruiter or an expert data scientist, I would REALLY APPRECIATE your honest feedback.

Please take some time to give me feedback, that will help me to improve!

For anything, write to me using the [Contact](https://dattanibedita.github.io/#contact) section.

I run few pages on social media where I post new facts every weekday.
